# ChestReader App
This software uses pre-trained vgg16 with U-NET convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to recognise tuberculosis on chest x-rays with having model accuracy 97% and validation accuracy 88% and The model is trained on a Dataset of 800 images(which is very small dataset) from two sources Shenzhen and Montgomery respectively. the app is live here : https://chestscanner.cfapps.io/
the app is running on the cloud for free,so it can crash sometimes,just refresh and retry.
[Note : this app will never crash if you run it locally on our computer]
